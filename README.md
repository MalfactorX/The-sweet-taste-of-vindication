# The-sweet-taste-of-vindication
Nothing hits home for me like the way you feel when no matter what someone else tries to do to keep you from succeeding....you still find a way to win in the end.
Everything is better when you win. The air is sweeter, the colors are noticiably brighter and even your food tastes better.
